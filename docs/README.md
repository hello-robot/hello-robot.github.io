# New to Stretch?
We recommend you follow the [Getting to Know Stretch Tutorials](https://docs.hello-robot.com/0.2/stretch-tutorials/getting_started/README.md). 

Please take the time to learn safe and best practices in operating Stretch.  

**The Stretch RE1 is a potentially dangerous robot. All users must carefully read the [Stretch Safety Guide](robot_safety_guide.md) prior to using the robot.**
# Where to Find Things 
All of the documentation is accessible and searchable via the navigation menu on this site. Alternatively, you can view the markdown hosted on at the [Hello Robot GitHub portal](github.com/hello-robot).
