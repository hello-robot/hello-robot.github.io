### Trunk

Development and charge ports are at the back of the base in the trunk. The trunk cover slides into place vertically and is non-latching.

The trunk height has been designed to accommodate one or more USB based Intel Neural Compute Sticks.

Two mounting holes are provided inside the trunk. These allow the user to strain relief tethered cables (eg, HDMI and keyboard) during development. It is recommended to strain relief such cables to prevent accidental damage during base motion.

#### Pan Tilt

The head pan-tilt unit utilizes two Dynamixel XL430-W250-T servos. It incorporates a small fan in order to ensure proper cooling of the servo and camera during dynamic repeated motions of the tilt DOF.

The nominal ‘zero’ position is of the head is shown below, along with the corresponding range of motion.

  </tr>
</table>

#### ReSpeaker Microphone Array
The ReSPeaker has 12 RGB LEDs that can be controlled programatically. By default they display sound intensity and direction of the microphone array. The ReSpeaker has 4 mems microphones mounted on a 64.61mm circle at 45 degree spacing. The drawing below shows the position and orientation of the microphone array relative to the head pan axis.

![image alt text](./images/stretch_head_respeaker.png)

#### Runstop

The runstop allows the user to pause the motion of the four primary DOF (base, lift, and arm) by tapping the illuminated button on the head. When the runstop is enabled, these DOF are in a ‘Safety Mode’ that inhibits the motion controller at the firmware level. Disabling the runstop allows normal operation to resume. 

### Lift

The lift degree of freedom provides vertical translation of the arm. It is driven by a closed loop stepper motor, providing smooth and precise motion through a low gear-ratio belt drive. The ‘shoulder’ includes two mounting holes and a small delivery tray.

### Arm

![image alt text](./images/arm_top.png)

The arm comprises 5 telescoping carbon fiber links set on rollers. Its proprietary drive train is driven by a stepper motor with closed loop control and current sensing, allowing contact sensitivity during motion.

The arm exhibits a small amount of play (lash) in the X, Y, Z, and theta directions which is a normal characteristic of its design. Despite this it can achieve good repeatability, in part because its gravity loading is fairly constant.

The retracted arm and wrist combined are designed to fit within the footprint of the base. The arm is designed to have:

* Reach: 0.52m

### Wrist

The wrist includes:

* Yaw DOF to allow for stowing of the tool
* 2 Aruco tags for calibration and visual localization of the tool
* Expansion port with
  * Arduino expansion header
  * USB-A connector
* Tool plate with dual sided mounting
* Dynamixel X-Series TTL bus

#### Wrist Control Interface

The wrist yaw degree-of-freedom uses a [Dynamixel XL430 servo](http://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xl430-w250-t/). Additional Dynamixel servos can be daisy chained off of this servo, allowing for one more additional degree-of-freedoms to be easily  integrated onto the robot (such as the provided Stretch Gripper). 

Stretch comes with a XL430 compatible control cable preinstalled into this servo. If a different cable needs to be installed the servo cap can be removed as shown.

![image alt text](./images/wrist_cap_rs.png)

#### Wrist Tool Plate

The tool plate allows for mounting on the top or the bottom using the M2 bolt pattern. The mounting pattern is compatible with Robotis Dynamixel frames as well:

* [FR12-H101K](http://www.robotis.us/fr12-h101k-set/)
* [FR12-S102K](http://www.robotis.us/fr12-s102k-set/)
* [FR12-S101K](http://www.robotis.us/fr12-s101k-set/)

![image alt text](./images/tool_mount_rs.png)

#### Wrist Yaw Range of Motion

The wrist yaw DOF is calibrated so that the index hole faces forward at the 'zero' position. From this pose the wrist has a ROM of +256/-76 degrees as shown.

![image alt text](./images/tool_rom_rs.png)

#### Wrist Accelerometer

The wrist includes a 3 axis [ADXL343](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL343.pdf) accelerometer which provides bump and tap detection capabilities. The  sensor is mounted inside the distal link of the arm as shown below.

![image alt text](./images/wacc_accel_top_rs.png)

![image alt text](./images/wacc_accel_side_rs.png)

#### Wrist Expansion USB

The wrist includes a USB 2.0 A interface. This power to this USB port is fused to 500mA@5V.

#### Wrist Expansion Header

The wrist includes an expansion header that provides access to pins of the wrist Arduino board.  The header connector can be accessed by removing the cap at the end of the arm.

![image alt text](./images/wrist_expansion_port_rs.png)

The header is wired to a Atmel SAMD21G18A-AUT ([datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/SAM_D21_DA1_Family_DataSheet_DS40001882F.pdf)) microcontroller (same as Arduino Zero). The expansion header pins are configured at the factory to allow:

* General purpose digital I/O
* Analog input

In addition, the firmware can be configured for other pin functions, including:

* Serial SPI
* Serial I2C
* Serial UART

The [Stretch Firmware Manual](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_firmware) covers this modification.

**The header pins utilize 3V3 TTL logic. They do not have interface protection (eg, ESD, over-voltage, shorts). It is possible to damage your robot if pin specifications are exceeded **

The pin mapping is:

The expansion DIO uses a 10 pin JST header [B10B-PHDSS(LF)(SN)](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/jst-sales-america-inc/B10B-PHDSS-LF-SN/455-1762-ND/926668).  It is compatible with a [JST PHDR-10VS](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/jst-sales-america-inc/PHDR-10VS/455-1158-ND/608600) housing. JST provides pre-crimped wire compatible with this housing ( part [APAPA22K305](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/jst-sales-america-inc/APAPA22K305/455-3086-ND/6009462)).

Pin 1 & 10 are indicated below.

### Gripper

The Stretch Compliant Gripper utilizes a Dynamixel XL430-W250-T servo to drive the spring grasper mechanism. The kinematics of the grasper mechanism are complex and non-linear relative to the motor position.  As shown, it includes mounting features on  one side to allow for attachment of simple rigid tools such as [hooks and pullers](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_tool_share/tree/master/puller_v1).

</table>

The attachment features are spaced at 9mm.

The weight of the Stretch Compliant Gripper is 240g.

#### Gripper Removal

Here we describe removing the Stretch Compliant gripper. Installation is simply these steps in reverse.

1. Unplug the Dynamixel cable from the back of the gripper. 
2. Remove the 4 screws holding the gripper to the bracket.
3. Remove the gripper from the mounting bracket
4. Unscrew the 8 screws holding the mounting bracket to the bottom of the tool plate.

## Robot Care 

### Battery Maintenance

Please review the [Battery Maintenance Guide](./battery_maintenance_guide.md) for proper care and charging of the Stretch batteries.

### Belt Tension

A neoprene timing belt drives the arm up and down the lift. It may detension over long periods of time if it experiences sustained loading. In this case, slack will become visually apparent in the belt as the lift moves.

The belt is very straightforward to re-tension. Please contact support@hello-robot.com for tensioning instructions.

### Keeping the Robot Clean

The robot surfaces can be wiped down with an alcohol wipe or a moist rag from time to time in order to remove and debris or oils that accumulate on the shells or mast. 

The drive wheels can accumulate dust over time and begin to lose traction. They should be periodically wiped down as well.

When possible, the Trunk cover for the base should be kept on in order to keep dust and debris out of the Trunk connectors.

If the D435i camera requires cleaning use appropriate lens cleaning fluid and a microfiber cloth.

### Keeping the Robot Calibrated

The robot comes pre-calibrated with a robot-specific URDF. This calibration allows the D435i depth sensor to accurately estimate where the robot wrist, and body, is in the depth image.

The robot may become slightly uncalibrated over time for a variety of reasons:

* Normal wear and tear and loosening of joints of the robot
* The head structure is accidentally load and the structure becomes very slightly bent
* The wrist and should structure become accidentally highly loaded and become slightly bent

The calibration accuracy can be checked using the provided ROS tools. If necessary, the user can recalibrate the robot. See the [Stretch URDF Calibration Guide](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_ros/blob/master/stretch_calibration/README.md) for more information.

### Transporting the Robot

Stretch was designed to be easily transported in the back of a car, up a stair case, or around a building.

For short trips, the robot can be simply rolled around by grabbing its mast. It may be picked up by its mast and carried up stairs as well. 

**For safety, please use two people to lift the robot.**

For longer trips it is recommended to transport the robot in its original cardboard box with foam packaging. The metal protective cage that surrounds the head is only necessary if the robot might be shipped and the box will not remain upright.

### System Check

It is useful to periodically run stretch_robot_system_check.py. This  will check that the robot's hardware devices are  present and within normal operating conditions.
