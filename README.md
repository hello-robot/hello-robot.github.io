# Stretch Docs Generator

This repository generates the documentation hosted at [https://docs.hello-robot.com](https://docs.hello-robot.com).

The website is generated by aggregating markdown files that are distributed among Stretch's repos. The markdown lives alongside the code it documents, making it easier to keep both in sync. This repo has the role of pulling these repos in as git submodules and integrating them together using the plugin `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin`.

We use [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme to build the website. Our customization to the default theme can be found in the `docs/overrides` and `docs/extra.css` files. Additionally, we use `mike` for version management. There has been a few versions of Stretch Docs, and visiting [https://docs.hello-robot.com](https://docs.hello-robot.com) automatically redirects to the latest version: 0.3 at the time of this writing. Each version of the docs can be found in a different branch of this repo.

There is a Github Action set up on each submodule included here. Whenever changes to markdown docs merge into mainline in those repos, it automatically trigger a rebuild and deploy of the website here. For a history of deployments, check out the [actions tab](https://github.com/hello-robot/hello-robot.github.io/actions) on Github.

## Setup

Follow these steps to get set up with developing on the docs:

```
git clone https://github.com/hello-robot/hello-robot.github.io
cd hello-robot.github.io
./install.sh

# choose a version of the documentation (details below)
git checkout 0.3
git submodule update --init
```

### Choose a version

Each version of the documentation is on a separate branch.

```commandline
/repos/hello-robot.github.io$ git branch
  0.1
  0.2
  0.3
  gh-pages
```

V0.1 was released with the launch of Stretch RE1. V0.2 was released with the Ubuntu 20.04-based OS upgrade for Stretch robots. V0.3 was released with the launch of Stretch 3.

By using versioning, you can find old docs even as new tutorials and APIs are released. All content is maintained under the version branch. This master branch is mostly empty.

The branch `gh-pages` is a special orphan branch that the documentation build is pushed to using the Mike versioning plug-in for MkDocs. This branch is hosted via GitHub Pages at [https://docs.hello-robot.com](https://docs.hello-robot.com),

## Previewing Edits

Make edits in the respective repo. For example, if you're updating a tutorial for Stretch Body, edit the markdown file in that repo and open a PR there. Then, pull it here:

```commandline
cd repos/<repo>
git checkout <pr>

cd ../..
mkdocs serve
```
You can then preview the content at site http://localhost:8000

## Deploying Edits

**Note**: There's a Github Action set up on most Stretch repos. If a docs change is merged into mainline there, it automatically rebuilds the website and deploys it here. You can check that your change deployed by looking at the [actions tab](https://github.com/hello-robot/hello-robot.github.io/actions) on Github.

If, for example, the version under edit is 0.1, you can push the edits to the webserver by:
```commandline
cd ~/repos/hello-robot.github.io
mike deploy 0.1 --push
```
This will push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch and the edits will be reflected at [docs.hello-robot.com](docs.hello-robot.com). 

**Note**: It may take time / browser refreshes for the changes to be correctly reflected at [docs.hello-robot.com](docs.hello-robot.com),

## Making a new version
To make a new version, for example:
```commandline
cd ~/repos/hello-robot.github.io
git pull
git checkout 0.2
git branch 0.3
git checkout 0.3

<make edits>

mike deploy 0.3 'experimental' -t '0.3: Experimental development' --push
```

Note the format for the title (-t). Keep a consistent naming structure. Also note that this version is aliased as `experimental`. 

## Adding a New Submodule Repo
```commandline
cd ~/repos/hello-robot.github.io/repos
git submodule add https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_foo
```

## Updating a Submodule Repo
Start by ensuring your submodules are present:

```
cd ~/repos/hello-robot.github.io/repos
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Once the repos are present you can update them all to the latest commit using:

```
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```

Finally, if you want to update the submodules on Github (requires push access), commit the submodules update using:

```
git add .
git commit -m 'Update all submodules'
git push
```

## Editing a Submodule Repo
For example, Stretch Body:

```commandline
cd ~/repos/hello-robot.github.io/repos/stretch_body
git pull
```
Make sure you've pulled the latest version and are on the desired branch. After making your edits you can test them by:
```commandline
mkdocs serve
...
INFO     -  [21:47:17] Browser connected: http://127.0.0.1:8000/stretch_body/
```
When the submodule site is as desired, check the changes into Git. Then deploy the edits using Mike:
```commandline
cd ~/repos/hello-robot.github.io/
mike deploy 0.2 --push
mike serve
```

## Other Tips

The currently hosted versions that are managed by mike can be found with
```commandline
~/repos/hello-robot.github.io$ mike list
"0.2: Beta (WIP)" (0.2) [beta]
"0.1: Latest" (0.1) [latest]
```
The default version that is present at is the one with the alias `latest` as defined in mkdocs.yaml:
```commandline
extra:
  version:
    provider: mike
    default: latest
```
To release a version update its alias to `latest`. Also update its title to accurately reflect this. See the [Mike documentation](https://pypi.org/project/mike/) for more information.
